# React Array Methods Demo

This is a small React project that demonstrates the use of common JavaScript array methods (map, filter, reduce, forEach) in a real-world application context.

## The app displays a list of products and allows you to:

View all products

Filter affordable products (≤ $1000)

Calculate the total price of displayed products

Log product names to the console (via forEach)

## 🚀 Features

map → render the product list dynamically

filter → show only affordable products

reduce → calculate the total price of visible products

forEach → log each product name to the console

## 📂 Project Setup

create a new React project with vite:

npm create vite@latest
cd simple-webpage
npm install
npm run dev

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

React 18+

JavaScript (ES6+)

CSS (basic styling)

## 🎓 Learning Outcome

This project helps you understand how JavaScript array methods can be applied in practical scenarios inside a React app.

map → rendering lists

filter → conditional display

reduce → data aggregation

forEach → side effects (logging)

## 📌 Example Use

Click "Show Affordable (≤ $1000)" to filter the list.

Watch the total price update based on the displayed products.

Open the browser console to see product names logged via forEach.
